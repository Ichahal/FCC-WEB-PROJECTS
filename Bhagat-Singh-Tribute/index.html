            Bhagat Singh (September 1907 – 23 March 1931) was a charismatic
            Indian revolutionary who participated in the murder of a junior
            British police officer and an Indian head constable in mistaken
            retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist. He also took
            part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative
            Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of
            sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a
            household name in Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23
            into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India. Borrowing ideas from
            Bolshevism and anarchism, he electrified a growing militancy in
            India in the 1930s, and prompted urgent introspection within the
            Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually successful
            campaign for India's independence.

            In still later years, Singh, an atheist and socialist in adulthood,
            won admirers in India from among a political spectrum that included
            both communists and right-wing Hindu nationalists. Although many of
            Singh's associates, as well as many Indian anti-colonial
            revolutionaries, were also involved in daring acts and were either
            executed or died violent deaths, few came to be lionised in popular
            art and literature as did Singh, who is sometimes referred to as the
            Shaheed-e-Azam ("Great martyr" in Urdu and Punjabi).

          Bhagat Singh was born on 27 September 1907 in the village of Banga in
          the Lyallpur district of the Punjab in what was then British India and
          is today Pakistan; he was the second of seven children—four sons, and
          three daughters—born to Vidyavati and her husband Kishan Singh Sandhu.
          Bhagat Singh's father and his uncle Ajit Singh were active in
          progressive politics, taking part in the agitation around the Canal
          Colonization Bill in 1907, and later the Ghadar Movement of 1914–1915.

        <p>
          After being sent to the village school in Banga for a few years,
          Bhagat Singh was enrolled in the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic School in
          Lahore. In 1923, he joined the National College in Lahore, founded two
          years earlier by Lala Lajpat Rai in response to Mahatma Gandhi's
          non-cooperation movement, which urged Indian students to shun schools
          and colleges subsidized by the British Indian government.

        <p>
          Police became concerned with Singh's influence on youths and arrested
          him in May 1927 on the pretext that he had been involved in a bombing
          that had taken place in Lahore in October 1926. He was released on a
          surety of Rs. 60,000 five weeks after his arrest. He wrote for, and
          edited, Urdu and Punjabi newspapers, published in Amritsar and also
          contributed to low-priced pamphlets published by the Naujawan Bharat
          Sabha that excoriated the British. He also wrote for Kirti, the
          journal of the Kirti Kisan Party ("Workers and Peasants Party") and
          briefly for the Veer Arjun newspaper, published in Delhi. He often
          used pseudonyms, including names such as Balwant, Ranjit and Vidhrohi.

        <p>
          In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru,
          both members of a small revolutionary group, the Hindustan Socialist
          Republican Association (also Army, or HSRA), shot dead a 21-year-old
          British police officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, Punjab, in what is
          today Pakistan, mistaking Saunders, who was still on probation, for
          the British senior police superintendent, James Scott, whom they had
          intended to assassinate. They held Scott responsible for the death of
          a popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai for having ordered
          a lathi (baton) charge in which Rai was injured and two weeks
          thereafter died of a heart attack. As Saunders exited a police station
          on a motorcycle, he was felled by a single bullet fired from across
          the street by Rajguru, a marksman. As he lay injured, he was shot at
          close range several times by Singh, the postmortem report showing
          eight bullet wounds. Another associate of Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad,
          shot dead an Indian police head constable, Channan Singh, who
          attempted to give chase as Singh and Rajguru fled. After having
          escaped, Bhagat Singh and his associates used pseudonyms to publicly
          announce avenging Lajpat Rai's death, putting up prepared posters that
          they had altered to show John Saunders as their intended target
          instead of James Scott.

        <p>
          Singh was thereafter on the run for many months, and no convictions
          resulted at the time. Surfacing again On 8 April 1929, Singh,
          accompanied by Batukeshwar Dutt, threw two bombs into the Assembly
          chamber from its public gallery while it was in session.[38] The bombs
          had been designed not to kill, but some members, including George
          Ernest Schuster, the finance member of the Viceroy's Executive
          Council, were injured. The smoke from the bombs filled the Assembly so
          that Singh and Dutt could probably have escaped in the confusion had
          they wished. Instead, they stayed shouting the slogan "Inquilab
          Zindabad!" ("Long Live the Revolution") and threw leaflets. The two
          men were arrested and subsequently moved through a series of jails in
          Delhi.
        </p>
        <p>
          The arrest, and the resulting publicity, brought to light Singh's
          complicity in the John Saunders case. Awaiting trial, Singh gained
          public sympathy after he joined fellow defendant Jatin Das in a hunger
          strike, demanding better prison conditions for Indian prisoners, the
          strike ending in Das's death from starvation in September 1929. Bhagat
          Singh was convicted of the murder of John Saunders and Channan Singh,
          and hanged in March 1931, aged 23. He became a popular folk hero after
          his death.

        <p>
          Bhagat Singh was sent to Central Jail Mianwali from the Delhi jailand
          there he witnessed discrimination between European and Indian
          prisoners. He considered himself, along with others, to be a political
          prisoner. He noted that he had received an enhanced diet at Delhi
          which was not being provided at Mianwali. He led other Indian,
          self-identified political prisoners he felt were being treated as
          common criminals in a hunger strike. They demanded equality in food
          standards, clothing, toiletries, and other hygienic necessities, as
          well as access to books and a daily newspaper. They argued that they
          should not be forced to do manual labour or any undignified work in
          the jail.
        </p>
        <p>
          The government tried to break the strike by placing different food
          items in the prison cells to test the prisoners' resolve. Water
          pitchers were filled with milk so that either the prisoners remained
          thirsty or broke their strike; nobody faltered and the impasse
          continued. The authorities then attempted force-feeding the prisoners
          but this was resisted. With the matter still unresolved, the
          government decided to advance the start of the Saunders murder trial,
          Singh, still on hunger strike, had to be carried to the court
          handcuffed on a stretcher; he had lost 14 pounds (6.4 kg) from his
          original weight of 133 pounds (60 kg) since beginning the strike.
        </p>
        <p>
          The government was beginning to make concessions but refused to move
          on the core issue of recognising the classification of "political
          prisoner". By now, the condition of another hunger striker, Jatindra
          Nath Das, lodged in the same jail, had deteriorated considerably. The
          Jail committee recommended his unconditional release, but the
          government rejected the suggestion and offered to release him on bail.
          On 13 September 1929, Das died after a 63-day hunger strike. Singh
          finally heeded a resolution of the Congress party, and a request by
          his father, ending his hunger strike on 5 October 1929 after 116
          days.[44] During this period, Singh's popularity among common Indians
          extended beyond Punjab.

          Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were sentenced to death in the Lahore
          conspiracy case and ordered to be hanged on 24 March 1931. The
          schedule was moved forward by 11 hours and the three were hanged on 23
          March 1931 at 7:30 pm in the Lahore jail. It is reported that no
          magistrate at the time was willing to supervise Singh's hanging as was
          required by law. The execution was supervised instead by an honorary
          judge, who also signed the three death warrants, as their original
          warrants had expired. The jail authorities then broke a hole in the
          rear wall of the jail, removed the bodies, and secretly cremated the
          three men under cover of darkness outside Ganda Singh Wala village,
          and then threw the ashes into the Sutlej river, about 10 kilometres
          (6.2 mi) from Ferozepore.
