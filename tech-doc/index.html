        <p>
          Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
             Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
          </li>
          <li>
            An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.
          </li>
          <li>
            Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Property identifiers have to be a String or a variable that references a String</li>
          <li>It is okay to use variables, spaces, and Strings that start with numbers</li>

        <header>Array in Object</header>
        <p>Arrays are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. Neither the length of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed. Since an array's length can change at any time, and data can be stored at non-contiguous locations in the array, JavaScript arrays are not guaranteed to be dense; this depends on how the programmer chooses to use them. In general, these are convenient characteristics; but if these features are not desirable for your particular use, you might consider using typed arrays.</p>

        <p>Much like array's, We can also make Objects inside our Object's.</p>

        <header>Function in Object</header>
        <p>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.</p>
        <p class="bold">How to make Function in an Object:</p>
        <code>
          profile.birthYear = function () {<br>
            return this.dayMonthYear[2] - this.age;<br>
          };
